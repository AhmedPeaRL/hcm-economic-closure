## No Feedback Loops

The following feedback loops are explicitly forbidden:

- Money → Structural Change
- Demand → Increased Production
- Success → Higher Frequency
- Failure → Correction or Optimization

The system does not adapt economically.

Any emergence must arise independently
of economic signals.
