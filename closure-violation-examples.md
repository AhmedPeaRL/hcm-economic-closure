## Closure Violation Examples

The following statements constitute violations:

- "This sold well, we should repeat it."
- "People want more of this type."
- "We should open a new channel because demand exists."
- "Revenue indicates direction."

Even when expressed with positive intent,
such statements breach the economic closure.
